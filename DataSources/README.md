# Data sources used during Porto mission 2022.

- `tide` contains raw data and converted indices, raw data contains all months, but converted indices only include specific month for the mission.
- `wind` contains raw data and converted indices. Same applies here.

- `delft3d` data is saved in a separate folder since it is too big.

- `mohid` data source from `maretec`.
