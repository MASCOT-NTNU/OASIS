# Note for AndrÃ©

- Step 0, whenever you are in a folder called `catkin_ws`, please set up the environment using `source devel/setup.bash`. 
- Step I, launch the bridge `roslaunch bridge.launch` to check if everything is running correctly.
- If so, launch the bridge in no-hop mode `roslaunch bridge.launch > /dev/null 2>&1 &`
- Step II, launch the mission script `python3 Launcher.py` in each src folder, OP1 and OP2 first to check if everything is running correctly.
- If so, launch the mission script in no-hop mode `python3 Launcher.py > /dev/null 2>&1 &`
- Step III, check `htop` to obverse if all the processes are running properly.
- If so, wait maybe roughly 30 seconds before activating the program in neptus.

- launch everthing with `> /dev/null 2>&1 &`
